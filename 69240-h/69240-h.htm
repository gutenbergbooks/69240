<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>I</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>There</span> has come upon us, suddenly, one of those inexplicable
lulls which make the experienced seafarer in the
Mediterranean recall bygone voyages out East. It is as if
the ship had run abruptly into some sultry and airless
chamber of the ocean, a chamber whose cobalt roof has
shut down tight, and through which not a breath is moving.
The smoke from the funnel, of a sulphurous bronze color,
even while our trail yet lies somnolent in a long smear on
the horizon, now goes straight to the zenith. The iron
bulwarks are as hot as hand can bear, as the westering sun
glows full upon the beam. Under the awnings the troops
lie gasping on their rubber sheets, enduring silently and
uncomprehendingly, like dumb animals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far ahead, the escort crosses and recrosses our course.
Still farther ahead, a keen eye can detect a slight fraying
of the taut blue line of the horizon. Signals break from
the escort and are answered from our bridge. I turn to a
sergeant who is shambling to and fro by the machine-room
door, and inform him that Port Said is in sight, and
that he will be in harbor in an hour or so.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, just as suddenly as we entered, the door of
that heated chamber of the sea opens and we pass out
into a warm humid wind. The wind and the news wake
everybody. The soldiers, who have encamped on our
after-deck during the voyage, suddenly display a feverish
activity. Rations are packed, rifles are cleaned, and I am
in the full tide of popular favor because I permit oil-reservoirs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to be replenished in the machine-room and
furnish those priceless fragments of old emery cloth which
give such a delectable and silvery gloss to the bolts. Later,
I am so popular that I could almost stand for Parliament,
for I tell the sergeant that each man can fill his waterbottle
with iced water. Which they proceed to do at once,
so that said water gets red-hot before the moment of
disembarkation!</p>

<p class='c010'>But take a look at these men on our after-deck while we
are coming up to Port Said. You have never seen them
before and you will not see them again, for they are bound
for Bagdad and beyond. They are very representative,
for they are of all ages, races, and regiments. They are
going to join units which have been transferred. Three
were hours in the water when their ship was torpedoed.
Several have come overland across France and Italy, and
got most pleasantly hung up at entrancing cities on the
way. Others have come out of hospitals and trenches in
Macedonia and France and Flanders. They are Irish,
Scottish, Welsh, and English. The sergeant, now thumbing
a worn pocket-book, has seen service in India, China,
Egypt, and France.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind him, on the hatch, is a boy of eighteen who wears
the uniform of the most famous regiment in the British
Army. He is small for his age, and he has a most engaging
smile. When I asked him how on earth he got into the
Army he explained that he had ‘misriprisinted his age.’
He has a chum, a gaunt Highlander, who scarcely opened
his lips all the voyage, and who sat on the hatch sewing
buttons on their clothes, darning their stockings, and
reading a religious pamphlet entitled <i>Doing it Now</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another sergeant, too, a young gentleman going
home to get a commission. He is almost to be described
as one apart, for he holds no converse with the others. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>walks in a mincing way, he has a gold watch with a curb-chain
on one wrist, a silver identification plate and a silver
slave-bangle from Saloniki on the other, and an amethyst
ring on one of his fingers. As the Chief Engineer said to me
one day, he needed only a spear and a ring through his
nose to be a complete fighting man. However, in this
war it is unwise to make snap judgments. I understand
that this young gentleman has an aptitude for certain
esoteric brain-work of vast use in artillery. He never goes
near the firing-line at all. Our young friend Angus MacFadden
has that job. When the young gentleman with
the slave-bangle and gold-mounted fountain-pen and expensive
Kodak has figured out certain calculations in his
dug-out office, Angus, who resembles an extremely warlike
bellhop, with his gaunt Highland chum beside him,
will scramble up out of his trench, make a most determined
rush toward a given point, and, in short, complete the
job, whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now it is all very well to talk about the triumphs of
mind over matter, but my interest is not with the young
gentleman at all. He may carry Omar Khayyam in his
kit. He may call the ‘Shropshire Lad’ ‘topping poetry.’
He may (as he does) borrow Swinburne from my bookshelf.
My interest is with Angus and his chums. I look
out of my machine-room window and watch them getting
ready to disembark. They are very amusing, with their
collapsible aluminium pannikins, their canvas washbasins
and buckets, their fold-up shaving tackle and telescopic
tooth-brushes.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one tough old private of the Old Army among
them. He has the Egyptian and two South African medals.
He never seems to have any kit to bother him. I see
him in the galley, peeling potatoes for their dinner, deep
in conversation with the pantryman and smoking an Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>clay. He knows all the twenty-one moves, as we say.
Then there is a very young man who reads love stories
all the time, a rosy-cheeked lad with the Distinguished
Service Order ribbon on his tunic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another, almost as young, is tremendously interested in
refrigeration. He comes into my engine-room and stares
in rapt incredulity at the snow on the machine. ‘I don’t
see why it doesn’t melt!’ he complains, as if he had a
grievance. ‘How <i>do</i> you freeze? if it isn’t a rude question.’</p>

<p class='c010'>I explain briefly how we utilize the latent heat of re-evaporation
peculiar to certain gaseous media, in order to
reduce the temperature. He turns on me with a rush of
frankness and bursts out, ‘But, you know, that’s all
Greek to me!’ Well, I suggest, his soldiering’s all Greek
to me, come to that. He laughs shortly, with his eyes on
the ever-moving engines, and says he supposes so. By
and by he begins to talk of his experiences in Macedonia.
He thinks the sea is beautiful, after the bare hot gulches
and ravines. He is so fair that the sun has burned his face
and knees pink instead of brown. I asked him what he was
doing before the war, and he said his father had a seed-farm
in Essex and he himself was learning the business.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile we have arrived at Port Said. The engines
stop and go astern violently, and the pilot comes alongside
in a boat and climbs the rope-ladder. Just ahead is
the breakwater, with a couple of motor patrols keeping
guard over the fairway. Our escort puts on speed and
goes in, for her job with us is done. She has gone in to
coal, and she will be ready in a few hours to take another
transport out. She and her sisters are like us—they are
never through. The big ships may lie for days, or even
weeks, in harbor. We small fry have to hurry. Back and
forth we ply without ceasing. Sometimes we run ashore
in our haste, and so make less speed. Sometimes we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>smash into each other in the dark, and have to stagger
back to port and refit with all possible expedition. Sometimes,
too, we go out and never come back, and nobody
save the authorities and our relatives hears anything about
it. To what end? Well—and herein lies my interest in
those soldiers of the King on the after-deck—the one
ultimate object we have in view is to get Master Angus
MacFadden and his chums into that front-line trench, to
keep them there, warm and fed, and fully supplied with
every possible assistance when they climb over the parapet
to make the aforesaid rush. Everything else, when
you come to think of it, is subordinate to that.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ship goes at half-speed now past the breakwater, a
long gray finger pointing northwards from the beach.
Half-way along we pass the De Lesseps statue on its
high pedestal, the right hand flung out in a grandiose
gesture toward the supreme achievement of his life. The
warm wind from the westward is sending up the sea to
break in dazzling white foam on the yellow sand below
the pink and blue and brown bathing-huts. The breakwater
is crowded with citizens taking the air, for the
walks of Port Said are restricted and flavored with the
odors of Arabian domesticity. We pass on, and the hotels
and custom-house buildings come into view. All around
are the transients of the ocean, anchored and for a moment
at rest. Past the Canal building we steam, a pretentious
stucco affair with three green-tiled domes and deep Byzantine
galleries. Past also Navy House, a comely white
building in the Venetian style, recalling the Doge’s Palace—an
illusion heightened by the fleet of patrols anchored
in front, busily getting ready to go out to work.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then we stop, and manœuvre, and go astern; tugs
whistle imperiously, motor-boats buzz around us, ropes
are hurriedly ferried across to buoys and quays, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>are made fast and pulled into our berth alongside of an
immense vessel which has come from the other side of the
world with frozen meat to feed Master Angus and his
chums. But by this time it is dark. The ochreous sheen on
the sky behind Port Said is darkening to purple and violet,
the stars are shining peacefully over us, and the sergeant
comes to ask for a lantern by which to finish packing his
kit.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been warm during the day, but now it is stifling.
We are, as I said, close alongside a great ship. She extends
beyond us and towers above us, and even the warm
humid breeze of Port Said in August is shut out from us.
Up from below comes a suffocating stench of hot bilge.
The ship is invaded by a swarm of Arab cargo-men, who
begin immediately to load us from our neighbor. Cargo
lights, of a ghastly blue color, appear at the hatchways.
Angus and his chums take up their kits and fall in on the
bridge-deck. Officers hurry to and fro. Hatches are taken
off, and the cold air of the holds comes up in thin wisps of
fog into the tropic night. Winches rattle. Harsh words of
French and Arabic commingle with the more intelligible
shouts of the ship’s officers. All night this goes on. All
night proceeds this preposterous traffic in frozen corpses
amid the dim blue radiance of the cargo-clusters. Hundreds
upon hundreds of frozen corpses!</p>

<p class='c010'>I go off watch at eight and, seated in a room like a
Turkish bath, I try to concentrate on the letters which
have come over the sea. I am seized with a profound depression,
arising, I suppose, from the bizarre discrepancy
between the moods communicated by the letters and my
own weariness. Most letters are so optimistic in tone.
They clap one on the back and give one breezy news of
the flowers in New Jersey gardens, of the heat in New
Orleans, of bombs in London and reunions in English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>houses. All very nice; but I have to get up at two, and
the thermometer over my bunk is now registering a hundred
Fahrenheit. An electric fan buzzes and snaps in the
corner and seems only to make the air hotter. An Arab
passes in the alleyway outside and calls to some one
named Achmet in an unmelodious howl. (All male Arabs
are named Achmet apparently.)</p>

<p class='c010'>I sit in my pajamas, with the letters in my hand, and
wonder how long it is going to last. Another week or so
and we shall have had two years of it. Most of us have
gone home on leave. Counting the commander, there are—let
me see—four of us left of the original crowd. It is
over a year since I applied for leave. Nothing will come of
it. I look into the future and see myself, a gray elderly
failure, still keeping a six-hour shift on a Mediterranean
transport, my life spent, my friends and relatives all dead,
Angus and his chums gone west, and a new generation
coming out, with vigorous appetites for fresh provisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then the door opens and lets in a slight uniformed
figure with a grip in his hand and a familiar smile on his
face. Lets in also liberty, freedom, pay-day, England,
Home and Beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is my relief, arrived at last!</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>II</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>We greet each other shyly, for the chief and some of the
others are standing in the alleyway, with broad grins on
their faces at my look of flabbergasted bewilderment. An
Arab porter comes along with a big canvas bag of dunnage,
which he dumps at our feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why—what—how—when—did you get here?’
I ask weakly.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Train from Alexandria,’ he replies, sitting down on the
settee.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>My kitten, a sandy little savage known as O’Henry,
jumps up and begins to make friends. O’Henry is stroked
and tickled, and Tommy looks up at me with his old
tolerant, bland, imperturbable smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘You, of all people!’ I remark, looking at him inanely.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Aye, they sent me out,’ he affirms. ‘They told me you
were here. How’s things?’</p>

<p class='c010'>The others go away, still smiling, and I shut the door.
For this young chap, who has come across Europe to relieve
me, is an old shipmate. We were on the Merovingian.
We have been many voyages to Rio and the Plates. We
were always chums. In some obscure fashion, we got on.
Tommy is North Country—dry, taciturn, reticent, slow
to make friends. A hot-air merchant makes him restive
and he goes away. He abhors bluffers. I like him. We
have never written, though, for it is a fact that some friendships
do not ‘carry’ in a letter. They are like some wines—they
do not travel. For all I knew, I was never to see
him again. What of that? We had been chums and we
understood each other. I had often thought of him since
I’d been out here—a good little shipmate. And now here
he was, on my settee, smiling and tickling O’Henry just
where he likes to be tickled, and asking me to come ashore
with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Will I come ashore with him? Will I not? I drag open
drawers, fling out a white-drill suit, and begin to dress. I
open the door and shout to the messman to go and get a
boat and bring my shoes and some hot water. While I
shave, Tommy relates his adventures in a sketchy way.
He has no gift of tongues, but now and again he strikes out
a phrase that brings the picture before me. He has been
torpedoed. He was in the Malthusian when she was
‘plugged.’ He was on watch, of course,—Thirds always
are on watch when anything happens. I used to tell him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that he was the original of Browning’s ‘Shadowy Third,’
he is so small, with delicate hands and that charming,
elusive, shadowy smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, I remark, as I reach for the talcum powder, he was
torpedoed, was he? He nods and smiles at O’Henry’s
trick of falling off the settee head over heels. And the poor
old Malthusian too,—what a box of tricks she was, with
her prehistoric pumps and effervescent old dynamo,—gone
at last, eh? Tommy says nothing about the catastrophe
save that he lost his gear. Then, he observes, he joined
the Polynesian as Third, having, of course, got himself
fresh gear. Ah, and had I heard about the Polynesian?
She’s gone too, he said, letting O’Henry down to the floor
by his tail. What? Torpedoed too? It must be a sort of
habit with him. Good Heavens! But no, says Tommy, she
was attacked, but she got away, and—</p>

<p class='c010'>‘It was a funny thing,’ he adds meditatively; and looks
at me as though he couldn’t make it out.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What,’ I ask, ‘what happened?’ as I look around for
my stick and cigar-case.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, I’ll tell you when we get ashore,’ he says; and he
rolls O’Henry into a ball and drops him on my bunk.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Come on, then.—Sam! Got that boat?’</p>

<p class='c010'>A negro voice howls, ‘Yes, sah,’ and we go out and down
the ladder.</p>

<p class='c010'>A three-quarter moon is coming up, hangs now over
Palestine, and Port Said, the ancient Pelusium, takes on a
serene splendor inconceivable to those who have seen her
only in the hard dusty glare of noon-day. The harsh outlines
of the ships soften to vague shadows touched with
silver; the profound gloom within the colonnades of the
Canal building, the sheen of the moonlight on green domes
and gray stucco walls make of it a fairy palace of mist
and emerald. Each motor-launch speeding past leaves a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>broadening, heaving furrow of phosphorescence. Each dip
of our oars breaks the dark water into an incredible swirl
of boiling greenish-white radiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tommy and I sit side by side in the stern in silence as
the Arab boatman, in blue gown and round white cap, pulls
us up to the Custom-House quay. We pass out at a side
gate and find ourselves in Egyptian darkness. Whether
this is due to military exigencies or to a shortage of fuel,
nobody seems to know. The hotel buildings along the
front throw their shadows right across the Sharia el Legera,
down which we pass until we reach the broad dusty Rue el
Nil, a boulevard running straight down to the sea. We are
bound for the Eastern Exchange Hotel, familiarly known
as ‘The Eastern.’ It is the grand rallying-point of mariners
east and west of Suez. It is a huge gaunt structure of glass
and iron, built over to the curb of the street and the arcade
under it is full of green chairs and tables, green
shrubs in enormous tubs, and climbing plants twined about
the iron stanchions. The lights are shrouded in green
petroleum cans, and one has the illusion of sitting in the
glade of some artificial forest. Hotel waiters, in long white
robes cut across with brilliant scarlet sashes, and surmounted
by scarlet fezes, move noiselessly to and fro with trays
of drinks. An orchestra, somewhere beyond, plays a plaintive
air.</p>

<p class='c010'>All around are uniforms naval and military, British,
French, Italian, and so forth. It is here, I say, that East
and West do meet. Here the skipper from Nagasaki finds
an old shipmate just in from New Orleans. Here a chief
engineer, burned brown and worn thin by a summer at
Basra, drinks with a friend bound East from Glasgow to
Rangoon. Here the gossip of all the ports of the Seven
Seas changes hands over the little tables under the dim
green-shaded lights. Outside, beyond the screen of verdure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>a carriage will go by stealthily in the dust, a cigar
glowing under the hood. Itinerant salesmen of peanuts in
glass boxes, beads, Turkish delight, postals, cigarettes,
news-sheets, postage-stamps, and all the other passenger
junk, pass to and fro. A native conjuror halts as we sit
down, sadly produces a dozen lizards from an apparently
empty fez, and passes on as I look coldly upon his peripatetic
legerdemain. Here and there parties of residents sit
round a table—a French family, perhaps, or Italian, or
Maltese, or Greek, or Hebrew, or Syrian—for they are
all to be found here in Pelusium, the latter making money
out of their conquerors, just as, I dare say, they did in
Roman times. Papa is smoking a cigarette; Mamma is sitting
back surveying the other denizens of the artificial
forest through her lorgnon; the young ladies converse with
a couple of youthful ‘subs’ in khaki, and a bare-legged boy,
in an enormous pith hat like an inverted bath, is haggling
over half a piastre with a vender of peanuts. Tommy and
I sit in the shadow of a shrub and I order gin and lime-juice.
He wants beer, but there is no beer—only some
detestable carbonated bilge-water at half a dollar (ten
piastres) the bottle.</p>

<p class='c010'>And soldiers go by continually to and from the cafés and
canteens. Many are Colonials, and their wide-brimmed
hats decorated with feathers give them an extraordinarily
dissipated air. There is something very un-English about
these enormous, loose-limbed, rolling fighting-men, with
their cheeks the color of raw beef and their truculent eyes
under their wide hats. They remind me at times of the
professional soldiers of my school-days, who dressed in
scarlet and gold and were a race apart. As they pass us, in
twos and threes and singly, slouching and jingling their
spurs, and roll off into darkness again, I think of Master
Angus MacFadden and his chums, and I wonder what the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>future holds for us all. Then I hear Tommy talking and I
begin to listen.</p>

<p class='c010'>No use trying to tell the story as he told it. Whoever
thinks he can, is the victim of an illusion. Tommy’s style,
like his personality, is not literary. I often wonder, when I
think of the sort of life he has led, how he comes to express
himself at all. For he often startles me with some queer
semi-articulate flash of intuition. A direct challenge to Life!
As when he said, looking up at me as we leaned over the
bulwarks and watched the sun rise one morning in the
Caribbean, ‘Yo’ know, I haven’t <i>had</i> any life.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, as I said, he and I are chums on some mysteriously
taciturn, North Country principle that won’t bear talking
about! And I must tell the story in my own way, merely
quoting a phrase now and then. I owe him that much because,
you see, he was there.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>III</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>That voyage he made in the Polynesian was her usual
London to South American ports. And nothing happened
until they were homeward bound and making Ushant. It
was a glorious day, as clear as it ever is in northern waters,
and the Third Mate was astonished to see through his
glasses what he took to be land. Ushant already! As he
looked, he saw a flash and his wonder deepened. He told
himself, well, he’d be blowed! A tremendous bang a hundred
yards abeam of the Polynesian nearly shook him overboard.
It has come at last, then!</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Man came from his room, running sideways, his
face set in a kind of spasm, and stood by the rail, clutching
it as if petrified. The Third Mate, a friend of Tommy’s,
pointed and handed the binocular just in time for the Old
Man to see another flash. The morning telegraph clanged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and jangled. The Third Mate ran to the telephone and
was listening, when the second shell, close to the bows,
exploded on the water and made him drop the receiver.
Then he heard the Old Man order the helm over—over—over,
whirling his arm to emphasize the vital need of putting
it hard over. A few moments of tense silence, and
then, with a roar that nearly split all their ear-drums, the
Polynesian’s six-inch anti-raider gun loosed off at nine
thousand yards.</p>

<p class='c010'>So you must envisage this obscure naval engagement on
that brilliant summer day in the green Atlantic. Not a ripple
to spoil the aim, not a cloud in the sky, as the two gunners,
their sleeves rolled to the shoulders, their bodies
heaving, thrust a fresh shell and cartridge into the breech,
shoved in the cap, and swung the block into place with the
soft ‘cluck’ of steel smeared with vaseline. As the ship
veers, the gun is trained steady on the gray dot. Nine
thousand and fifty, no deflection—‘Stand away!’ There
is another roar, and the gunner, who has stood away, now
stands with his feet apart, his elbows out, staring with
intense concentration through his glasses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Down below, the engine-room staff, which included
Tommy doing a field-day on the spare generator, were
clustered on the starting platform. The expansion links had
been opened out full,—any locomotive driver will show
you what I mean,—and the Polynesian’s engines, four
thousand seven hundred horse-power indicated, driven by
steam at two hundred pounds to the square inch from her
four Scotch boilers, were turning eighty-nine revolutions
per minute and making very good going for her, but nothing
to write home about, when a modern submersible
cruiser doing sixteen knots on the surface was pelting after
her. The tremendous explosions of the six-inch gun discouraged
conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The Chief Engineer, a tall man with a full chestnut
moustache and a stern contemptuous expression born of
his hatred of sea-life, was striding up and down the plates.
The Second appeared, like Ariel, around, above, below,
intent on sundry fidgets of his own, and whistling—nobody
knew why. The Fourth was in the stokehold and
back in the engine-room every ten minutes. The Fifth, as
though he had been naughty and was being punished by
that stern man with the four gold-and-purple wings on his
sleeve, was standing with his face to the wall, big rubber
navy-phone receivers on his ears and his eyes fixed in a
rapt saintly way on two ground-glass discs above him, one
of which was aglow and bore the legend <i>More Revolutions</i>.
The other, <i>Less Revolutions</i>, was dull and out of use. So he
stood, waiting for verbal orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the revolutions possible were being supplied, for the
safety-valves were lifting with an occasional throaty flutter.
Unexpectedly the Second would appear from the
tunnel, where he had been feeling the stern gland, and
would hover lovingly over the thrust-block, whistling,
amid the clangor of four thousand seven hundred horse-power,
‘Love me, and the world is mine.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly all was swallowed up, engulfed, in one heart-shattering
explosion on deck. It was so tremendous that
the Fifth’s head involuntarily darted out from the receivers
and he looked sharply at the Chief, who was standing
stock-still with his long legs apart, his hands in his coat
pockets, staring over his shoulder with stern intentness
into vacancy. The telephone bell brayed out a call and
the Fifth fitted his head once again to the receiver. ‘Yes,
sir!’ he sang out; and then, to the others, ‘We’re gainin’
on her! We’re gainin’ on her!’ Tommy goes on methodically
with his dynamo. He is close at hand when wanted,
ready, resourceful, devoid of panic. The excitement is on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>deck, where the shell has struck the house amidships,
blowing the galley ranges and bakehouse ovens overboard,
killed three men outright, and left two more mere moving
horrors on the slaughter-house floor. Another, a scullion,
with his hand cut off at the wrist, is running round and
round, falling over the wreckage, and pursued by a couple
of stewards with bandages and friar’s balsam.</p>

<p class='c010'>And on that gray dot, now nine thousand five hundred
yards astern, there is excitement too, no doubt, for it
seems authentic that the Polynesian’s third shot hit the
forward gun-mounting, and the list caused by this, heavy
things slewing over, the damage to the deck, the rupture of
certain vital oil-pipes, and the wounds of the crew, would
account for the Polynesian, with her fourteen-point-seven
knots, gaining on U 999, supposed to have sixteen knots
on the surface.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the bridge of the Polynesian, too, there is excitement
of sorts. The Chief Mate, who has been rushing about,
helping the ammunition carriers, then assisting the stewards
with their rough surgery, then up on the bridge again,
has come up and is prancing up and down, every now and
then looking hard at the Old Man, who stares through the
telescope at the gray dot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something awful had happened. When that shell hit
the ship, the Old Man had called out hoarsely, ‘That’s
enough—oh, enough—boats!’ and the Chief Mate, to
the horror of the young Third Mate, who told Tommy
about it, grabbed the Old Man round the waist, whirled
him into the chart-room, and slammed the door upon them
both. The Third Mate says he saw, through the window,
the Chief Mate’s fist half-an-inch from the Old Man’s
nose, the Old Man looking at it in gloomy silence, and the
Chief Mate’s eyes nearly jumping out of his head as he
argued and threatened and implored. ‘... Gainin’ on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>her,’ was all the Third Mate could hear, and ‘... For
God’s sake, sir!’ and such-like strong phrases. So the Third
Mate says. And then they came out again, and the Mate
telephoned to the engine-room.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>IV</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The company is dwindling now, for, as Tommy gulps his
drink and orders two more, it is on the stroke of nine,
when the bars close, and folks are melting group by group
into the darkness. Some are bound for home, some for
‘Eldorado,’ a dusty barn where one watches dreadful melodramatic
films and faints with the heat. The lights are
turned still lower. The few shops which have been open in
a stealthy way now shut up close. The moonlight throws
sharp blue-black shadows on the white dust of the Rue el
Nil. The orchestra fades away; chairs are stacked between
the tubs, and reproachful glances are cast upon the dozen
or so of us who still linger in the gloom.</p>

<p class='c010'>I become aware that Tommy, in his own odd little
semi-articulate fashion, is regarding me as though he
had some extraordinary anxiety on his mind. That is the
way his expression strikes me. As though he had had some
tremendous experience and didn’t know what to make of
it. I remember seeing something like it in the face of a
youth, religiously brought up, who was listening for the
first time to an atheist attempting to shake the foundations
of his faith. And while I ruminate upon this unusual portent
in Tommy’s physiognomy, he plunges into the second
part of his story. It has its own appeal to those who love
and understand the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the rest of the day the Polynesian’s course was a
series of intricate convolutions on the face of the Atlantic.
As the Third Mate put it in his lively way, you could have
played it on a piano. Owing to the wireless room having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>been partially demolished, they were out of touch with
the world, and the commander felt lonely. He even regretted
for a while that he had not retired. Was just going
to, when the War came. He was sixty years old, and had
been an easygoing skipper for twenty years now. This,—and
he wiped his moist face with his handkerchief,—this
wasn’t at all what he had bargained for when he had
volunteered to carry on ‘for the duration of the War.’
Men dead and dying and mutilated, ship torn asunder—He
sat on his settee and stared hard at the head and shoulders
of the man at the wheel, adumbrated on the ground-glass
window in front of him. He had turned sick at the
sight down there—</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Polynesian was still going. Not a bolt, rivet,
plate, or rod of her steering and propelling mechanism
had been touched, and she was galloping northwest by
west at thirteen knots. The commander hoped for a dark
night, for in his present perturbed state the idea of being
torpedoed at night was positively horrible. The Brobdingnagian,
now, was hit at midnight and sunk in three
minutes with all hands but two. He wiped his face again.
He felt that he wasn’t equal to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was dark. All night it was dark and moonless. All
night they galloped along up-Channel. All night the Old
Man walked the bridge, watching the blackness ahead. At
four o’clock the Mate came on watch and the Old Man
felt that he must lie down. He was over sixty years old,
remember, and he had been on his feet for eighteen hours.
The Chief Mate, who had been strangely shy since his outrageous
behavior, merely remarked that it looked as if it
might be thick presently, and began to pace to and fro.</p>

<p class='c010'>What happened,—if anything did happen,—nobody
seemed to know; but Tommy, who came off at four, and
was enjoying a pipe, a cup of cocoa, and a game of patience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in his room, was suddenly flung endways against his wardrobe,
and a series of grinding crashes, one of which sent his
porthole glass in a burst of fragments over his bed-place,
buckled the plates of the ship’s side. He remembered that
the wardrobe door flew open as he sprang up, and his derby
hat bounced to the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>He at once skipped down below, where he found the
Second and Chief trying to carry out a number of rapid
contradictory orders from the telegraph. And as he
joined them the telegraph whirled from <i>Full astern</i> to
<i>Stand by</i>, and stopped. They stood by. Tommy was told
to go and finish ‘changing over,’ which involves opening
and shutting several mysterious valves. Having achieved
this, he took up his station by the telegraph.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Chief, clad in a suit of rumpled but elegant
pink-and-saffron-striped pajamas, prowled to and fro in front of the
engines like one of the larger carnivora in front of his cage. The
Second, with the sleeves of his coat rolled up, as if he were a
conjuror and wished to show there was no deception, produced a
cigarette from his ear, a match from an invisible ledge under the
log-desk, and then caused himself to disappear into the stokehold,
whistling a tune at one time very popular in Dublin called ‘Mick
McGilligan’s Daughter Mary Ann.’ He returned in some mysterious
fashion, smoking with much enjoyment, and reporting greaser, firemen,
and Tommies all gone up on deck.</p>

<p class='c010'>And so they waited, those three, and waited, and waited;
and the dawn came up, ineffably tender, and far up above
them through the skylights they saw the stars through the
fog turn pale, and still there was no sign, the telegraph
finger pointing, in its mute peremptory way, at <i>Stand by</i>.
They were standing by.</p>

<p class='c010'>And at length it grew to be past endurance. The Chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>spoke sharply into the telephone. Nothing. Suddenly he
turned and ordered Tommy to go up and see what was doing.
The Second, coming in from the stokehold, reported
water in the cross-bunker, but the doors were down. So
Tommy went up the long ladders and out on deck and stood
stock-still before the great experience of his life. For they
were alone on the ship, those three. The boats were gone.
There was no sound, save the banging of the empty blocks
and the gurgle and slap of the sea against her sides.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment, Tommy said, he ‘had no heart.’ The
sheer simplicity of the thing unmanned him, as well it
might. He hadn’t words—Gone! Behind the horror lay
another horror, and it was the reminiscence of this ultimate
apprehension that I saw in his face to-night. And
then he threw himself backward (a North Country football
trick), turned, and rushed for the ladder. The other
two, down below, saw him there, his eyes feverish, his face
dark and anxious, his usually low voice harsh and strident,
as he prayed them to drop everything and come up quick—come
on—and his voice trailed off into huskiness and
heavy breathing.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they came up, which happened immediately, four
steps at a time, they found him sprawled against the bulwarks,
his chin on his hands, looking as though to fix the
scene forever on his brain. And they looked too, and
turned faint, for there, far across the darkling sparkle of
the sea, were the boats, and on the sky-line a smear of
smoke. So they stood, each in a characteristic attitude—Tommy
asprawl on the rail, the Second halfway up the
bridge-deck ladder, one hand on his hip, the Chief with his
hands behind him, his long legs widely planted, his head
well forward, scowling. They were as Tommy put it, ‘in a
state.’ It wasn’t, you know, the actual danger; it was the
carrying away of their faith in the world of living men.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Good God! And I imagine the prevailing emotion in their
hearts at this moment was instinct in the lad’s query to
me—‘What was the use of goin’ back, or making a fight
of it, if <i>that</i> was all they thought of us?’ And then the
Polynesian recalled them from speculations as to the ultimate
probity of the human soul by giving a sudden lunge
forward. She was sinking.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment, Tommy says, they were ‘in a state.’ I
should imagine they were. They began running round and
round the deck, picking up pieces of wood and dropping
them in a shamefaced manner. Suddenly the Chief remembered
the raft—an unfortunate structure of oil-barrels
and hatches. It was on the foredeck, a frowsy incumbrance
devised by the Mate in a burst of ingenuity against
the fatal day. When the three of them arrived on the foredeck
their hopes sank again. A single glance showed the
impossibility of lifting it without steam on the winches.
They stood round it and deliberated in silence, tying on
life-belts which they had picked up on the bridge-deck.
The Polynesian gave another lunge, and they climbed on
the raft and held tight.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Polynesian was in her death-throes. She had been
cut through below the bridge, and the water was filling
the cross-bunker and pressing the air in Number 2 hold up
against the hatches. While they sat there waiting, the
tarpaulins on the hatch ballooned up and burst like a gunshot,
releasing the air improvised within. She plunged
again, and the sea poured over her bulwarks and cascaded
around them. The raft slid forward against a winch, skinning
the Second’s leg against a wheelguard. They held on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, it is perfectly simple in theory to sit on a raft and
allow a ship to sink under you. The ship sinks, and the
raft, retaining its buoyancy, floats. Quite simple, in theory.
In practice, however, many factors tend to vitiate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>simplicity of it. Indeed, it becomes so difficult that only
by the mercy of God could anybody attempt it and survive.
The foredeck of the Polynesian was like the foredeck
of most ships, cluttered up with hatch-combings,
winches, ventilator-cowls, steampipes, masts, derricks,
bollards, snatch-blocks, dead-eyes, ladders, and wire-rope
drums. Look forward from the promenade next time
you make a trip, and conceive it. As the Polynesian subsided,
she wallowed. Her centre of gravity was changing
every second, and the raft, with its three serious passengers,
was charging to and fro as if it were alive and trying
to escape. It carried away a ventilator, and then, for one
horrible instant, was caught in the standing rigging and
canted over. A rush to starboard released it, and the next
moment it was free. Only the windlass on the forecastlehead
was now above water forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>They saw nothing more of her. Not that she vanished
all at once, but the sucking whirlpools in which the raft
was turning over and reeling back on them kept them fully
occupied. And when at last they had coughed up the seawater
and wiped their eyes and looked at each other as
they floated in the gentle swell of a smiling summer sea,
she was gone. Only one thing destroyed their peace and
stood up before them like a spectre: she was lying at the
bottom, with her telegraph at <i>Stand by</i>. The deathless
sporting spirit of the race was expressed in these words:
‘You know, if it hadn’t been for <i>that</i>, it was a joke, man!’</p>

<p class='c010'>The moon rides high over Pelusium as we go back to
the ship. Tommy and I will keep the morning watch together
for once and talk over old times. Tomorrow I shall
go through the hot white dust of the Rue el Nil and be
paid off in the consul’s office for my two years’ labor. There
is a mail-boat next week, and perhaps I shall board her,
passenger-fashion, and go across the blue Mediterranean,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>through sunny France, across the English Channel, where
the Polynesian stands by forever, up through Sussex orchards
and over Surrey downs. And perhaps, as I idle
away the autumn in the dim beauty of the Essex fenland,
and as we drive in the pony-cart through the lanes, we
shall stop and the children will say, ‘If you stand up, you
can see the sea.’</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
